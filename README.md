## raw2curl

Converts raw HTTP based requests to curl (Unix).

**Inspiration** - I was facing few un-supported HTTP verb (like, `PATCH`) errors while using https://github.com/curl/h2c/.
<br>
<br>

## Usage Example 
```
$ cat sample-get-request.txt
GET /path?var=1 HTTP/1.1

Usage of raw2curl:

```

## Keep in mind
- Sometimes, protocol errors might occur even though itâ€™s a straightforward conversion to a curl flag (https://ec.haxx.se/http/versions/). A possible solution is to downgrade the protocol version.
- The output flag for the curl request is not provided, as it completely depends on your use case (https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html).
